## Phase 1 — Data Understanding and Preparation

**Goal**: Prepare a high-quality dataset for modeling.

**Tasks**

- Data loading: import the smart grid dataset into Python (Pandas).
- Initial inspection: review schema, missing values, and variable meanings.
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA):
  - Visualize demand over time to assess trend, seasonality, and anomalies.
  - Correlation analysis: heatmap to identify top 3–5 predictors
- Data cleaning and feature engineering:
  - Handle missing values appropriately.
  - Create features
  relevant time/auxiliary signals.

**Deliverable**: Clean, processed dataset and an EDA notebook with visuals and findings.

## Phase 2 — Modeling and Evaluation (Weeks 2–3)

**Goal**: Build, compare, and select the best forecasting model.

**Tasks**

- Baseline model (Multiple Linear Regression):
  - Train/test split.
  - Fit using key features from Phase 1.
- Advanced model (Random Forest or simple LSTM):
  - Train on the same split to enable fair comparison.
- Evaluation:
  - Predict on the test set with both models.
  - Report MAE and R².
- Comparison and conclusion:
  - Table or bar chart comparing MAE.
  - Brief rationale for the selected model.

**Deliverable**: Saved trained models and a notebook detailing training, evaluation, and comparison.

## Phase 3 — Application and Final Report (Week 4)

**Goal**: Operationalize the best model and communicate results.

**Tasks**

- Prediction script:
  - Python `.py` that loads the best model.
  - Accepts user inputs (e.g., temperature, time) and outputs predicted demand.
- Interpretation:
  - Feature importance plot (for Random Forest) to explain drivers.
- Final report/presentation:
  - Concise narrative of problem, data, methods, results, and demo.

**Deliverable**: Working prediction script, feature interpretation artifact, and final report/presentation.
